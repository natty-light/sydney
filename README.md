# Syntax

## Variables
A variable can eithe be mutable or constant. this is specified with the `mut` and `const` keywords.

Variable type annotations are optional for initialized variables:
```mut x = 5; const y = 5;

Constant variables must be initialized, mutable variables do not.
```const x = 5; mut int y;
